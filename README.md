## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary packages.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vaibhavp2129/ECG-Image-Classification-App.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ECG-Image-Classification-App
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

```

This will launch the app in your default web browser. Follow the instructions on the interface to upload ECG images and receive predictions.

## Models

### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

The ANN model is a foundational approach in deep learning. It consists of multiple layers of neurons, which learn from the input data to make predictions.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

CNNs are particularly effective for image data. They use convolutional layers to automatically extract features from images, which improves classification accuracy.

### VGG-19

VGG-19 is a deep learning model known for its depth and performance. It has 19 layers and is effective for complex image classification tasks.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is crucial for enhancing model performance. The following steps are included:

1. **Image Resizing**: Standardize image dimensions.
2. **Normalization**: Scale pixel values to a range of 0-1.
3. **Data Augmentation**: Apply techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase dataset variability.
4. **Balancing the Dataset**: Use SMOTE to address class imbalances.

## Real-time Predictions

The app provides real-time predictions for uploaded ECG images. Simply upload an image, and the model will analyze it and return the predicted class. This feature is powered by Streamlit, ensuring a seamless user experience.
